# excel-data

This showcases an ability to work with and manipulate data in the excel format
and extract whatever important information is necessary.

The json to excel was for a simple freelance job in which somebody needed
assistance learning how to extract the data from a json file and write it to a
spreadsheet

Example here:
[json_to_xl_example.xls](https://github.com/woods0813/excel-data/files/11803610/json_to_xl_example.xls)

getting_good_stations.py was used as assistance for a friend who works
at an advertising agency and wanted a quick way to find the stations and products
which had a high success (>1.0 on returns) and export that information to another
excel spreadsheet. It needs to be updated with an appropriate class to create a better
pipeline for the data as the script has many redundant blocks.

Outputs given in the appropriate spreadsheets:
[Good-Products-National-Cable.xlsx](https://github.com/woods0813/excel-data/files/11803635/Good-Products-National-Cable.xlsx),
[Good-Stations.xlsx](https://github.com/woods0813/excel-data/files/11803636/Good-Stations.xlsx)
